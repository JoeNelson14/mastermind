# mastermind
This game is called mastermind, the object of the game is there is a code maker
and a code breaker. You can choose if you want to be the maker or the breaker of
the code. If you choose to be the maker, then the computer will use Swaszek's
algorithm to try to guess the code you made in less then 12 tries. If you choose
to be the breaker, you will have to guess the code that the computer created in
less then 12 tries. Everytime a guess is made by you or the computer, a hint of
dots will be displayed next to your guess. A red dot means there is a number that
is in the right spot and the right number/color, a white dot means there is a
number that is the right number/color but wrong spot, no dot will be displayed if
neither the right spot or number/color was picked. There are 6 numbers you can
choose from, each resulting in a color. May the best decoder win!
